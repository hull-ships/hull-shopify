# Hull Shopify Ship

This ship changes links to login, logout and registration in your Shopify Shop to display Hull's Login Modal Ship instead of the full page. This allows customers to perform those actions without leaving their current page.

It also tracks Cart operations (View Product, Add, Remove and Change Quantities, Checkout) and associates them to the current user.

This requires you to install our [App on the Shopify Store](https://apps.shopify.com/hull-social-login) and our [Login Ship](https://ships.hull.io/hull-login/)
